			<h1>Introducing Stackey.com</h1>

			<p><a href="http://www.stackey.com" target="_blank">Stackey.com</a> is a place where you can stack just about anything. Discover new stacks of products that go together like peas and carrots, as recommended by people who care.</p>
			<p>It's a bit like Pinterest, but it's exclusively for products. Not a whole board of products, mind... just a stack of upto 5 special things!</p>

			<h2>What do you mean 'stack' things?</h2>
			<p>In technology, we often refer to stacks as the layers of different technologies we use to implement various parts of an application. I want people to be able to stack anything. Hell, you're probably stacking things and you aren't even aware of it!</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Do you have a few products you use on your face each morning?</li>
			<li>Your favourite gym kit, it all goes together, right?</li>
			<li>How about those nice pieces of kit you bought to make a proper coffee at home?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>These are all stacks!</strong> They can be recommended to friends, and are probably really nice products if YOU bought them :-)</p>

			<h2>Need some examples?</h2>
			<p>Here's a couple of stacks which will help explain the concept at a glance:</p>

			<h1>It's for discovery.</h1>
			<p>Like Pinterest, but for products.</p>
			<p><strong>For a while I found myself recommending Shaving products to friends</strong>, so I created <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stackey.com/#!/shaving-stack--XpazxwkWPC">My Shaving Stack</a>. This contains some excellent products I'd recommend to any guy who wants an upgrade from the cheap supermarket shave. Check it out...</p>

				<p>It features 5 items, which are named in the following way to make it easy to see how the things fit together to form a stack:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>The Ease Oil</strong> (ClarinsMen Shave Ease Oil)</li>
					<li><strong>The Shaving Cream</strong> (Proraso Shaving Cream)</li>
					<li><strong>The Brush</strong> (Edwin Jagger Best Badger Brush)</li>
					<li><strong>The Razor</strong> (Merkur Heavy Duty Slant Bar Safety Razor)</li>
					<li><strong>The Blades</strong> (Feather Double Edged Razor Blades)</li>

			<h2>It's early days, but it looks bright.</h2>
			<p>I'm thrilled so many of you have already joined, and YOU, reading this, I would love for you to <a href="http://www.stackey.com/#!/register" target="_blank">sign up<a> and have a go at creating some stacks too!</p>
			<p>I'll be following up this article with some tech and UX details, where I hope to explain how everything was made, including some design decisions around the UI, and a few little performance hacks. For the geeks amongst you, it's not to be missed!</p>
